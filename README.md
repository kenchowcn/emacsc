This is my emacs configuration, the original one is [emacs-kicker](https://github.com/dimitri/emacs-kicker), which inspired me to make my own configuration.

##Usage

    mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bk ; git clone https://github.com/kenchowcn/emacsc.git ~/.emacs.d

then, let el-get install plugin, after a while, open emacs again, you will see a different emacs.
